<title>AURORA DAKOTA</title>
		<p><h1><strong>aurora dakota rain asbury</strong> </h1></p>
		<p><em>Graphic Designer & Fashion Designer</em></p>
		<h1><strong>ABOUT</strong> </h1>
			<em>Aurora Dakota Rain</em> was born in 1994 in Birmingham, England. In 2003, her family packed up their bags and moved to America. Growing up she always had a vogue magazine in her hand, which she had filled with notes she believed Anna Wintour should read. She attended Moore College of Art & Design, graduating in 2016 with a BFA in Fashion Design and Graphic Design. While in college she interned as a Graphic Designer at Blair Lauren Brown, a small jewelry company, where she worked hands on with the owner to create branding materials. After college she was hired by Salon Clouds, a start up technology company as a UI Designer, to create websites and applications. This is where she began to combine her fashion and graphic design skills. She is thankful for her creative entrepreneur parents who inspired her to work hard and to be independent, leading her to begin her own journey.
